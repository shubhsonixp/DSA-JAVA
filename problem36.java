Kadane's Algorithm

Given an array Arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}
Output:
9
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is 9
of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which 
is a contiguous subarray.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {-1,-2,-3,-4}
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is -1 
of element (-1)

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function maxSubarraySum() which takes Arr[] and N as input parameters and returns the sum of subarray with maximum sum.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
-107 ≤ A[i] ≤ 107

Kadanes Alogrithm
Initialize:
    max_so_far = INT_MIN
    max_ending_here = 0

Loop for each element of the array
  (a) max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]
  (b) if(max_so_far < max_ending_here)
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
  (c) if(max_ending_here < 0)
            max_ending_here = 0
return max_so_far
Explanation: 
The simple idea of Kadane’s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this). And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this). Each time we get a positive sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far

    Lets take the example:
    {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3}

    max_so_far = INT_MIN
    max_ending_here = 0

    for i=0,  a[0] =  -2
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-2)
    Set max_ending_here = 0 because max_ending_here < 0
    and set max_so_far = -2

    for i=1,  a[1] =  -3
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-3)
    Since max_ending_here = -3 and max_so_far = -2, max_so_far will remain -2
    Set max_ending_here = 0 because max_ending_here < 0
      
    
    for i=2,  a[2] =  4
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (4)
    max_ending_here = 4
    max_so_far is updated to 4 because max_ending_here greater 
    than max_so_far which was -2 till now

    for i=3,  a[3] =  -1
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-1)
    max_ending_here = 3

    for i=4,  a[4] =  -2
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-2)
    max_ending_here = 1

    for i=5,  a[5] =  1
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (1)
    max_ending_here = 2

    for i=6,  a[6] =  5
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (5)
    max_ending_here = 7
    max_so_far is updated to 7 because max_ending_here is 
    greater than max_so_far

    for i=7,  a[7] =  -3
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-3)
    max_ending_here = 4
Note:

 The above algorithm only works if and if at least one positive number should be present otherwise it does not work I.e if an Array contains all negative numbers it doesn’t work.
